# Organoid tracking in microfluidic channels

Track organoids and extract essential trajectory props from masks. The segmentation proper is done in another file.

## Usage guide


### Preparation 

Check that [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) and Jupyter Notebook are installed on your computer.

### Download and open

In the terminal, copy paste the following code:

```
git clone https://github.com/JaulinLab/organoid_tracking.git
cd organoid_tracking
jupyter notebook
```

This should open a jupyter notebook window. Navigate to the `track_organoids.ipynb` file, open it. You're in! Now you just have to follow the instruction in the Jupyter Notebook page.
